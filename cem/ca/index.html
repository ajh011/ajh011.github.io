  <h1 id="title">Clifford Algebras</h1>
    <p id="blurb">
      We all know areas and volumes can be given a scalar magnitude. Clifford alegbras
      allow us to extend this magnitude and encode some orientation along with this magnitude 
      much as we do for oriented lengths as vectors. Effectively it's the mathematical 
      tool set that allows us to work with oriented n-dimensional slices of some space.
      It introduces many concepts sometimes with several names for similar objects, so for 
      those confused by these matters there is a small section here discussing, at large,
      these nuances and synonyms.
      <br>
      The exterior product is also known as the wedge product and is an effective
      generalization of the cross product sometimes encountered. Furthermore, the 
      exterior product (which we shall henceforth call the wedge product) defines
      an exterior algebra over some vector space. These exterior algebras are also known
      as the Grassman algebras, but they only include specifically sums of k-blades.
      Clifford algebras then allow us to define sums of arbitrary order blades (i.e. sums
      of blades not neccesarily of the same order), known as multivectors; this is accomplished
      with the introduction of a new product called the geometric product. Bivectors are effectively
      2-blades, just as trivectors are 3-blades. include blade definitions

      For ease of transition, we first define two products that can be combined
      to form the geometric product (however, both can be defined in terms only of the geometric
      product, as is shown later). The first is the familiar dot product, which most physicists are
      familiar with; the second is an antisymmetric product know as the wedge product 
      (or exterior product), which may
      not be encountered in a course of undergraduate classes. The wedge
      product is related to the cross product but only as a special case for
      three dimensions, which allows for an isomorphism between areas and spatial directions.

        Dot Product
      </h3>
      <p id="dpp">
        The dot product is a multi-linear symmetric product that given two blades of
        order \(k\) and \(l\) returns a blade of \(k-l\). It is something of a measure 
        of orthogonality, or mutual projection, in that two blades of the same dimension return zero if all
        the basis elements are orthogonal.

        Wedge Product

      <p id="dpp">
        The wedge product is a multi-linear antisymmetric product that given two blades of
        order \(k\) and \(l\) returns a blade of \(k+l\). It is something of a measure 
        of mutual rejection, in that two blades of the same dimension return zero if all
        the basis elements are parallel.
