      Neural Networks

    <p id="explanation">
      Neural Networks have become a mainstay of modern machine learning. They're 
      especially interesting because of their basic and understandable components,
      and their loose association with an idealized brain. They're easily implementable
      on pytorch and tensorflow, both python based machine learning modules. Here I'd
      like to link relevany ipy notebooks and maybe some notes once I write some up (create
      a nand gate, code mnist digit classifier, explicit form of neurons in latex).

        Here I should include '.ipy' notebooks for digit classification and a nand gate
