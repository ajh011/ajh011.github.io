       Symplectic Forms of Variational Mechanics
     </h1>
     <p id="expp">
       Here I'd like to link several resources for those interested in symplectic
       mechanics. Mostly those of others. I'll also attach my set that follows along
       with Tobias Osbourne's series, as well as link to his series itself (again).
