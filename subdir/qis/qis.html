            Quantum computers promise new computational paradigms, generally justified
            succintly with the discovery of Shor's Algorithim which demostrated that
            an operational quantum computer could crack RSA encryption schemes currently
            implemented on classical computers. Qiskit is a python module that 
            allows one to play with simulated (and some real from IBM!) quantum computers.
            Here I'd like to inlcude some qiskit .ipy notebooks and write up some 
            latex going over basic algorithims (maybe basics aswell?).
