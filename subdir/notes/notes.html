      <p>Here is a lab investigating the electro-optic response of a sample of
        Lithium Niobate utilizing a Sagnac Intereferometer: <a href="../../notes/eoptick.pdf">Electro-optic Results</a>
      </p>

      <p id="symplectic">
        Here is a very rough set of notes following along with Tobias Osbourne's
        lecture series on Symplectic Geometry and Classical Mechanics: 
        <a href="../../notes/sym/sym.pdf">Symplectic Notes</a>
      </p>
      
      <p>Here is a derivation of Lagrangian and Hamiltonian Mechanics from
      D'Alembert's Principle that I've been working on:

            Variational Mechanics</a></p>

      <p id="qft">
        Here is a short presentation I made to introduce (in an informal setting) 
        the Quantum Fourier Transform and Qiskit (a quantum computing module for python) to some
        interested colleagues: <a href="../../notes/qft/qiskit.pdf">QFT and Qiskit
