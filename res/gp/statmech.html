  <div class="flex stack">
    <p id="blurb">
      Statistical mechanics is the extrapolation of quantitative properties from systems of large numbers of particles (on the order of \(~10^{23}\) particles). The 
      general approach is to specify some system in terms of it's Hamiltonian, and then to apply some corresponding treatment
      of the system as a statistical ensemble defined by a specific set of macroscopic properties. Thus, statistical mechanics allows us to model
      macroscopic systems with large numbers of constituents quantitatively, by averaging over and modeling systems in terms of macroscopic properties. 
      Thermodynamics is a subset of this more general set of tools.

   <!-- <h2 id="motive">Motivation in Phase Space</h2>
    <p>
      Suppose you're modeling a system that is completely specified by it's Hamiltonian. In that case, the state of the system 
      may be modeled in phase space, where each point in phase space is a unique orientation of the system itself. Suppose, however,
      that you only know, or can only measure, the total energy of the system. Then our state of knowledge of the system can be modeled precisely
      as a probability distribution in this phase space.
    </p>
    <h3 id="equipartition">Equipartition Theorem</h2>
    <p>
      The equipartition theorem essentially states that the total energy of a system is, on average, distributed
      equally among all the degrees of freedom of the system. Explicity, it states that for any coordinate or conjugate 
      momentum \(x_i\) in some system defined by a Hamiltonian H, the average below is the same.
      <div class="eq">
        $$
          \overline{x_i\frac{\partial H}{\partial x_j}}=k_BT\delta_{i,j}
        $$
      </div>
    </p>-->
    <h2 id="thermo">Thermodynamic Relations</h2>
    <p>
      Perhaps the most intuitive thermodynamic function is the internal energy of a system. For a general
      system, the internal energy is defined as a function of the entropy, volume, and number of particles.
      Taking the exterior derivative of this then gives the relation
      <div class="eq">
    
      \begin{align}
        dU(S,V,N)&=\frac{\partial U}{\partial S}&dS & +&\frac{\partial U}{\partial V}&dV&+&\frac{\partial U}{\partial N}&dN&\\
                 &=T&dS&+&-P&dV&+&\mu &dN& \ \ \tiny{\text{(Euler Relation)}}
      \end{align}
      </div>
      Immediately, we see that the properties of temperature \(T\), pressure \(P\), and chemical potential \(\mu\) may
      be defined in terms of derivatives of the internal energy of the system. Such properties that are derivatives
      of the internal energy are termed intensive properties, as they are intrinsic to any arbitrarily selected portion
      of the overall system (i.e., any subsystem). However, the variables that determine the energy are all neccesarily extensive, in that 
      volume \(V\), entropy \(S\), and the number of particles \(N\) are a measure of the total system,  and are not
      properties inherent in any particular entity of those comprising the system. Particularly,
      extensive properties all meet the scalability condition of \(U\) in that \( \lambda U(S,V,N)= U(\lambda S,\lambda V,\lambda N)\).
    </p>
    

    <h3>Intrinsic Properties</h3>
    <p>
      As discussed above, intensive properties are those that characterize not the total system but inherent properties of
      any (adequately sized) subsystem contained within. As such, they're generally derivatives of state functions with respect to
      extensive properties of the system. 
      
    </p>
    <div class="eq">
        \begin{align}
          \frac{\partial U}{\partial S}&=&T\\
          \frac{\partial U}{\partial V}&=&-P\\
          \frac{\partial U}{\partial N}&=&\mu\\
        \end{align}
    </div>
    
    <h3>Extrinsic Properties</h3>
    <p>
      Extrinsic properties are those that only describe the collected system in it's entirety. That is,
      they are not properties inherent in any subsystem contained within. Rather, they're physical properties
      that only describe the system's overall extent and content. These properties generally include \(U\) (internal energy),  \(S\) (entropy), \(V\) (volume),
      and \(N\) (the number of particles); as well as other
      definable properties of this nature.
    </p>
    <!--<div class="eq">
        \begin{align}
          \frac{\partial U}{\partial S}&=&-T\\
          \frac{\partial U}{\partial V}&=&P\\
          \frac{\partial U}{\partial N}&=&\mu\\
        \end{align}
    </div>-->

    <h3>Other Common Properties</h3>
    <p>
      Some other common properties that may be defined for thermodynamic systems are expansion coefficients, compressibilities, and 
      specific heats. Generally, they're specified with respect to some other state
      variable that doesn't appear explicitly in the defining relation itself. This can be taken as a signal that this component is being held constant, but
      it's more to specify that, in the relevant context, we're treating the relevant state function as a function of the variables referenced 
      (i.e. the one being differentiated w.r.t. and the one specified externally). Defining relations for some of these properties are specified 
      below for convenience.
    </p>
    <h5>Specific Heats</h5>
    <p>
      Specific heats describe the differential relationship between entropy and internal energy of the system.
    <div class="eq">
      \begin{align}
        c_v&=T\left(\frac{\partial S}{\partial T}\right)_V=\left(\frac{\partial S}{\partial U}\right)_V\\
        c_p&=T\left(\frac{\partial S}{\partial T}\right)_P=\left(\frac{\partial S}{\partial U}\right)_P
      \end{align}
    </div>
    </p>
    <h5>Compressibilities</h5>
    <p>
      Compressibilities describe how the volume of a system changes under changes in pressure.
    <div class="eq">
      \begin{align}
        \kappa_T&=-\frac{1}{V}\left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial P}\right)_T
      \end{align}
    </div>
    </p>
    
    <h5>Expansion Coefficients</h5>
    <p>
      Coefficients of volume expansion describe how volume changes under changes in temperature.
    <div class="eq">
      \begin{align}
        \alpha&=\frac{1}{V}\left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial T}\right)_{P,N}
      \end{align}
    </div>
    </p>

<h3>Laws of Thermodynamics</h3>
<h4>First Law</h4>
<p>
  The first law of thermodynamics is a statement of energy conservation. It essentially states that the internal energy of a system
  is only depepndent on the work done on the system and the heat absorbed by the system.
  <div class="eq">
    $$
    \Delta U = \Delta Q - \Delta W
    $$
  </div>
</p>
<h4>Second Law</h4>
<p>
  The second law defines the direction of time, in that it claims the sum of entropies of isolated systems is less than or equal to the entropy of
  the total system given the systems are then allowed to interact over time.
  <div class="eq">
    $$
    \delta Q = TdS
    $$
  </div>
</p>
<h4>Third Law</h4>
<p>
  The third law specifies that the entropy of any system approaches a constant value at zero temperature. Nernst's postulate further states that this 
  constant value is exactly zero, but this has been proven empirically false in certain systems, such as super cooled glasses.
  <div class="eq">
    $$
    \lim_{T\rightarrow 0}=C
    $$
  </div>
</p>

<div class="hl"></div>


    <h2 id="ensembles">Ensembles</h2>
    <p>
      A statistical ensemble, or just ensemble, is a particular approach for applying the methods of statistical mechanics. Effectively,
      ensembles are distributions in phase space, defined by a set of variables in a particular system completely specified by it's Hamiltonian.
    </p>

    <p>
      To to that end, ensembles are predetermined strategies for applying the methods of thermodynamics, and statistical mechanics at large,
      to systems characterized by a certain set of extensive or intensive properties. They can be thought of as the way in which we may distribute a certain 
      set of properties across all the potential arrangements in phase space that satisfy such properties. 
    </p>
    
    <br>
    <div class="dl"></div>

    
    <h3 id="micro">Micro-canonical Ensemble \( (E,N,V)\)</h3>
    <p>
      The micro-canonical ensemble can be used to model isolated or completely contained systems. That is, systems in which
      their total energy, number of particles, and volume can, at any instant, be completely specified.
    </p>
    <h4>General Approach in the Micro-Canonical Ensemble</h4>
    <h5>Classical</h5>
    <p>
      Suppose you are given some macroscopic system, specified by it's Hamiltonian, and know the system's energy. From this relation for energy and 
      the expectation that it is well defined for all potential arrangements of the system, we may calculate from it the number of accessible 
      states \(N_{\Gamma_a}\) in the relevant phase space \(\Gamma\) for any total internal energy \(E\).
      <div class="flex flexcol">
        <div id="microdiag">
          <img src="../../assets/images/res/gp/microdiag.svg" width="80%" max-width="5cm">
        </div>
        <div id="microcd">
          <img src="../../assets/images/res/gp/microcd.svg" width="100%">
        </div>
    </div>
      <div class="eq">
        $$
        N_{\Gamma_a}(E) = \int \frac{d\Gamma}{\Gamma_0} \delta (H(p_i,q_i)-E)
        $$
      </div>
      where the number of accesible states is really the volume of accessible phase space partitioned into quantized packets
      arbitrarily (though motivated by quantum mechanics). From this number of accessible states, we may derive the entropy for the
      system via the relation below and thence calculate arbitrary thermodynamic quantities.
      <div class="eq">
        $$
        S(U,V,N)=k_B lnN_{\Gamma_a}
        $$
      </div>

    </p>
    <h5>Thermodynamic Relations Relevant to Micro-Canonical Ensemble</h5>
    <p>
      Since the entropy of the system is the only result of this treatment, we may only perform thermodynamics in the micro-canonical
      ensemble. Nevertheless, it may be powerful for isolated systems. Relevant relations related to entropy \(S\) are specified below for convenience.
      
    <div class="eq">
      \begin{align}
        \frac{\partial S}{\partial U}&=&\frac{1}{T}\\
        \frac{\partial S}{\partial V}&=&-\frac{P}{T}\\
        \frac{\partial S}{\partial N}&=&\frac{\mu}{T}\\
      \end{align}
    </div>
    </p>
    
    <h5>Quantum Micro-Canonical Ensemble</h5>
    <p>
      In the quantum mechanical formalism, our micro-canonical ensemble is described as a density matrix of the form given below:
      <div class="eq">
        $$
        \rho=\sum_n p_n \vert\psi_n\rangle\langle\psi_n\vert
        $$
      </div>
      with \(p_n=1/D_n\) where \(D_n\) is the degeneracy of the nth energy level.
    </p>


    <div class="dl"></div>
    <br>

    <h3 id="canon">Canonical Ensemble \( (T,V,N)\)</h3>
    <p>
      The canonical ensemble is an approach suited for application to systems distinguishable from their surroundings, but which interact
      with their surrounding 'environment'. That is, this treatment may be applied to systems with a definite number of particles,
      volume, and temperature, but may still exchange energy within a larger system. Thus, the energy of our subsystem under analysis isn't entirely
      well-defined at an arbitrary time and it is neccessary to specify, or depend on, an intensive property of the system when defining it, hence the relevance of temperature.
    </p>
    
    <h4>General Approach in the Canonical Ensemble</h4>
    <h5>Classical</h5>
    <p>
      The general approach to modeling systems in the canonical ensemble is to solve for the particular partition function \(Z\) of the system, from which we may perform
      statistical mechanics. If one wishes to model such a system thermodynamically, the general approach then is to derive the Helmholtz free energy from \(Z\) and derive
      other thermodynamical properties from there. 


      <div class="flex flexcol">
        <div id="canondiag">
          <img src="../../assets/images/res/gp/canondiag.svg" width="80%" max-width="5cm">

        <div id="canoncd">
          <img src="../../assets/images/res/gp/canoncd.svg" width="100%">
        </div>
    </div>
      The partition function is defined for a system's Hamiltonian that may depend on the (specified) volume and number of particles of the system;
      the partition function is then only a function of temperature. Explicity, the partition function in the canonical ensemble is given by
      
      <div class="eq">
        $$
        Z(\beta) = \int \frac{d\Gamma}{\Gamma_0} e^{-\beta H}
        $$
      </div>

      and then from here, the Helmholtz free energy of the system is easily found via
      
      <div class="eq">
        $$
        F(T,V,N) = -k_B T ln Z = U - TS
        $$
      </div>
 
    </p>
    
    
    <h5>Statistical Relations Relevant to Canonical Ensemble</h5>
    <p>
      From the partition function, we may define the average value of energy (denoted by a bar above the operator) via
      
    <div class="eq">
      \begin{align}
        \overline{E}&=\frac{1}{Z}\int d\Gamma H\left( {p_i,q_i}\right)\ e^{-\beta H}\\
                    &=-\frac{\partial ln Z}{\partial \beta}\\
                    &=-\frac{\partial (\beta F)}{\partial \beta}=U\\
      \end{align}
    </div>
    Then, in the general case for cumulants:
    <div class="eq">
      \begin{align}
        \overline{\Delta E^n}&=(-1)^n\frac{\partial ^n ln Z}{\partial \beta^n}\\
                    &=(-1)^n\frac{\partial ^n(\beta F)}{\partial \beta^n}\\
                    &=(-1)^{n-1}\left(\frac{\partial }{\partial \beta}\right)^{n-1}\overline{E}
      \end{align}
    </div>
    </p>

    <h5>Thermodynamic Relations Relevant to Canonical Ensemble</h5>
    <p>
      Since the Helmholtz free energy is the system of state relevant to treatments in the canonical enesemble, relevant relations are specified below.
    <div class="eq">
      \begin{align}
        \frac{\partial F}{\partial T}&=&-S\\
        \frac{\partial F}{\partial V}&=&-P\\
        \frac{\partial F}{\partial N}&=&\mu\\
      \end{align}
    </div>
      Another important relation is that of specific heat, which is given below for the canonical ensemble.
    <div class="eq">
      $$
        c_v=\frac{\partial \overline{E}}{\partial T}
      $$
    </div>
    
    </p>
    <h5>Quantum Canonical Ensemble</h5>
    <p>
      In the quantum mechanical formalism, our canonical ensemble is described as a density matrix of the form given as:
      <div class="eq">
        $$
        \rho=\frac{1}{Z}\sum_n e^{-\beta E_n} \vert\psi_n\rangle\langle\psi_n\vert
        $$
      </div>
      with the relevant partition function \(Z\) defined as
      <div class="eq">
        $$
        Z=Tr(e^{-\beta H})
        $$
      </div>

    <h3 id="grand">Grand Canonical Ensemble \( (T ,V,\mu )\)</h3>
    <p>
      An approach to statistical mechanics apt for subsystems which further exchange particles with their surrounding environment, but are
      chemically indistinguishable from those elements of it's environment. Essentially, we replace dependence on the number of particles \(N\)
      with dependence on inherent chemical properties of these particles, namely their chemical potential \(\mu\).
    </p>
    
    <h4>General Approach in the Grand-Canonical Ensemble</h4>

      The general approach in the grand canonical ensemble is to solve for the particular partition function \(\mathcal{Z}\) of the system given by 
      the relation above.
      
      From here the grand potential of the system is easily found via
      
      <div class="eq">
        $$

      From the grand-canonical partition function, we may define the average value of an arbitrary operator via
      
    <div class="eq">
      $$
        \overline{A}=\frac{1}{\mathcal{Z}}\sum_{N=0}^{\infty}\int d\Gamma e^{-\beta(H_N-\mu N)}A_N

    <h5>Thermodynamic Relations Relevant to Grand-Canonical Ensemble</h5>
    <p>
      The grand potential \(\Omega \) is the system of state relevant to the  grand-canonical enesemble, and as such, relevant relations are specified below.
    <div class="eq">
      \begin{align}
        \frac{\partial \Omega}{\partial T}&=&-S\\
        \frac{\partial \Omega}{\partial V}&=&-P\\
        \frac{\partial \Omega}{\partial \mu}&=&-N\\

    <h2 id="distr">Distributions</h2>
    <p>
      Several probability distributions are particularly relevant for statistical mechanics. These generally include: the Maxwell-Boltzmann Distribution, relevant for
      classical thermal applications; the Fermi-Dirac Distribution, applicable to Fermionic quantum systems; and the Bose-Einstein Distribution, related to Bosonic quantum
      systems.
    </p>

    <h3 id="maxbolt">Maxwell-Boltzmann</h2>
      <p>
        The Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution describes the thermal distribution of the velocity of classical gasses. Note that it only applies in thermal equilibirium and
        to gases that aren't exhibiting some macroscopic flow.
        <div class="eq">
          \begin{align}
            f(v)=\left(\frac{m}{2\pi k_BT}\right)^{3/2}e^{-\frac{mv^2}{2k_BT}}
          \end{align}
        </div>

      </p>
    
    <div class="dl"></div>
    <h3 id="fermdir">Fermi-Dirac</h2>
      <p>
        Fermi-Dirac distributions are used to describe the probability of energy states being occupied for thermal Fermionic systems. Fermions obey the Pauli exclusion principle,
        as they have non-integer spin, which immediately resolves all degeneracies.
        <div class="eq">
          \begin{align}
            f(\epsilon _i)=\frac{1}{e^{(\epsilon_i-\mu)/k_BT}+1}
          \end{align}
        </div>
      </p>
      <h4>Sommerfeld Expansion</h4>
      <p>
        In the context of Fermi-Dirac statistics, we often come across integrals of the form:
        <div class="eq">
          \begin{align}
            \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f(\epsilon)\phi(\epsilon)d\epsilon.
          \end{align}
        </div>
        These are, generally, hard to solve. However, a convenient asymptotic expansion of the above is available for small temperatures
        and is known as the Sommerfeld expansion. The first few terms of the Sommerfeld expansion are given as:
        <div class="eq">
          \begin{align}
            \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f(\epsilon)\phi(\epsilon)d\epsilon\approx^{\text{low } T}\int_{-\infty}^{\mu}\phi(\epsilon)d\epsilon +\frac{\pi^2}{6}\left(\frac{1}{\beta}\right)^2\frac{d\phi}{d\epsilon}\big\vert_{\mu}+...
          \end{align}
        </div>
      </p>
    
    <div class="dl"></div>
    <h3 id="bosein">Bose-Einstein</h2>
      <p>
        Bose-Einstein distributions are used to describe the occupation of states of thermal Bosonic systems, which, in contrast to Fermions, can have several quanta occupying the same state.
        <div class="eq">
          \begin{align}
            f(\epsilon _i)=\frac{g_i}{e^{(\epsilon_i-\mu)/k_BT}-1}
          \end{align}
        </div>
        Here, it is important that the chemical potential \(\mu\) is always less than the ground state energy of the system.
