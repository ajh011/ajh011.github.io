  <h1 id="title">Statistical Mechanics</h1>
    <p id="blurb">
      Statistical mechanics is the extrapolation of quantitative properties from systems of large numbers of particles (on the order of \(~10^{23}\) particles). 
      Thermodynamics is a subset of this more general set of tools. 
    </p>
    <h2>Thermodynamic Relations</h2>
    <p>
      Perhaps the most intuitive thermodynamic function is the internal energy of a system. For a general
      system, the internal energy is defined as a function of the entropy, volume, and number of particles.
      Taking the exterior derivative of this then gives the relation
      <div class="eq">
    
      \begin{align}
        dU(S,V,N)&=\frac{\partial U}{\partial S}&dS & +&\frac{\partial U}{\partial V}&dV&+&\frac{\partial U}{\partial N}&dN&\\
                 &=-T&dS&+&P&dV&+&\mu &N& \ \ \tiny{\text{(Euler Relation)}}
      \end{align}
      </div>
      Immediatley, we see that the properties of temperature \(T\), pressure \(P\), and chemical potential \(\mu\) may
      be defined in terms of derivatives of the internal energy of the system. Such properties that are derivatives
      of the internal energy are termed intrinsic properties, as they are 'intrinsic' to any arbitrarily selection portion
      of the overall system. However, the variables that determine the energy are all neccesarily extrinsic, in that 
      volume \(V\), entropy \(S\), and the number of particles \(N\) are a measure of the total system,  and are not
      properties inherent in any particular entity of those comprising the system. Particularly,
      extrinsic properties all meet the scalability condition of \(U\) in that \( \lambda U(S,V,N)= U(\lambda S,\lambda V,\lambda N)\).
    </p>
    <h3>Intrinsic Properties</h3>
    <p>
      As discussed above, intrinsic properties are those that characterize not the total system but inherent properties of
      any (adequately sized) subsystem contained within. As such, they're generally derivatives of state functions with respect to
      extrinsic properties of the system. 
      
    </p>
    <div class="eq">
        \begin{align}
          \frac{\partial U}{\partial S}&=&-T\\
          \frac{\partial U}{\partial V}&=&P\\
          \frac{\partial U}{\partial N}&=&\mu\\
        \end{align}
    </div>
    
    <h3>Extrinsic Properties</h3>
    <p>
      Extrinsic properties are those that only describe the collected system in it's entirety. That is,
      they are not properties inherent in <em>any</em> subsystem contained within.    
    </p>
    <!--<div class="eq">
        \begin{align}
          \frac{\partial U}{\partial S}&=&-T\\
          \frac{\partial U}{\partial V}&=&P\\
          \frac{\partial U}{\partial N}&=&\mu\\
        \end{align}
    </div>-->
    <h2>Ensembles</h2>
    <p>
      Ensembles are effectively predetermined strategies for applying the methods of thermodynamics, and statistical mechanics at large,
      to systems characterized by a certain set of properties. They can be thought of as the way in which we may distribute a certain 
      set of properties across all the potential arrangements in phase space that satisfy such properties. 
    </p>
    <h3>Micro-canonical Ensemble \( (E,N,V)\)</h3>
    <p>
      An approach suited for isolated or entirely discernible systems that have a well-defined energy. From this relation for energy and 
      the expectation that it is well defined for all potential arrangements of the system, we may calculate from it the number of accessible 
      states \(N_{\Gamma_a}\) in it's phase space \(\Gamma\) for any total internal energy \(E\).
      <div id="microdiag">
        <img src="../../assets/images/res/gp/microdiag.svg" width="80%" max-width="5cm">
      </div>
      <div class="eq">
        $$
        N_{\Gamma_a}(E) = \int \frac{d\Gamma}{\Gamma_0} \delta (H(p_i,q_i)-E)
        $$
      </div>
      From this number of accessible states, we may derive the entropy for the system via the relation below and
      thence calculate arbitrary thermodynamic quantities.
      <div class="eq">
        $$
        S(U,V,N)=k_B lnN_{\Gamma_a}
        $$
      </div>
    </p>
    
    <h3>Canonical Ensemble \( (T,V,N)\)</h3>
    <p>
      The canonical ensemble is an approach suited for application to systems distinguishable from their surroundings, but that nonetheless, interact
      with their surrounding 'environment'. Thus, the energy of our subsystem under analysis isn't entirely well-defined at an arbitrary time and thus
      it is neccessary to depend on an intrinsic property of the system, namely temperature.
    </p>
    <p>
      <div id="canondiag">
        <img src="../../assets/images/res/gp/canondiag.svg" width="80%" max-width="5cm">
      </div>
      The general approach to modeling systems in the canonical ensemble is to solve for the particular partition function \(Z\) of the system given by
      
      <div class="eq">
        $$
        Z(\beta) = \int \frac{d\Gamma}{\Gamma_0} e^{-\beta H}
        $$
      </div>

      From here the Helmholtz free energy of the system is easily found via
      
      <div class="eq">
        $$
        F(T,V,N) = -k_B T ln Z = U - TS
        $$
      </div>
    </p>
    <h3>Grand Canonical Ensemble \( (T ,V,\mu )\)</h3>
    <p>
      An approach to statistical mechanics apt for application to subsystems that interchange particles with their surrounding environment, but are
      chemically indistinguishable from those elements of it's environment. Essentially, we replace dependence on the number of particles \(N\)
      with dependence on inherent chemical properties of these particles, namely their chemical potential \(\mu\).
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The general approach in the grand canonical ensemble is to solve for the particular partition function \(\mathcal{Z}\) of the system given by
      
      <div class="eq">
        $$
        \mathcal{Z}(\beta) = \int \frac{d\Gamma}{\Gamma_0} e^{-\beta (H-\mu N)}
        $$
      </div>

      From here the grand potential of the system is easily found via
      
      <div class="eq">
        $$
        \Omega(T,V,\mu ) = -k_B T ln\mathcal{Z} = U-TS-\mu N
        $$
      </div>
    </p>
