  <h1 id="title">Quantum Scattering</h1>
    <p id="blurb">
      Experimentalists often shoot particles (that are effectively plane waves) at material and
      observe what comes out a relatively far distance away. Two common approaches for modeling 
      such a scenario are the Born approximation and partial wave analysis. Below, we consider these 
      techniques in the case of a stationary target with spherical symmetry.

    <div id="cscatt">
      <img width="100%" height="auto" id="mvpeimg" src="../../assets/images/res/gp/cscatt.svg" alt="Diagram for generic scattering setup.">
    </div> 
    <p>
      Scattering is one of the key experimental techniques we have for probing the nature of matter. In most cases, we take the incident projectile to be a plane 
      wave and the output wave is generally approximated in some way, as a means to infer material structure from scattering data. We consider the scattering center to
      be some localized potential, so we have the following (time dependent) Schrodinger equation.
      <div class="eq">
        $$
          i\hbar \frac{d}{dt}\psi = \left[-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\nabla^2 +V(r)\right]\psi
        $$
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      We now consider a scenario in which we have an effectively stationary wave function in time. This may apply to scenarios where we
      run our apparatus for an extended period of time, such that we have a superposition of incident plane waves and scattered waves. This 
      gives us the relevant time independent Schrodinger equation defined below.
      <div class="eq">
        $$
          E\psi = \left[-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\nabla^2 +V(r)\right]\psi
        $$
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      We require that our solution for \(\psi\) includes an incident plane wave, which we will generally choose to align with 
      the z axis for simplicity. And now, we further suppose that the outgoing wave, the result of the scattering, is a spherical wave, with an
      amplitude potentially dependent on the solid angle (relative to the scattering center).
    </p>
    <div id="qscatt">
      <img width="100%" height="auto" id="mvpeimg" src="../../assets/images/res/gp/qscatt.svg" alt="Expected forms of wave functions for incident plane wave and spherical scattering target.">
    </div> 
    <p>
      <div class="eq">
      $$
      \psi(r,\phi,\theta) \sim Ae^{ikz}+Bf(\phi,\theta)\frac{e^{ikr}}{r}
      $$
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that this assumption only really works for observations made at a large radial distance from
      the scattering center. With this assumption in mind, working with this form allows us to make some headway. 
    </p>
    <h3 id="terms">Cross Sections</h3>
    <p>
      There are two types of relevant cross sections in scattering experiments with one target: the total cross section, that is, the area of the target as seen
      from the direction of the incident particle; and the differential cross section, which encodes how likely a scattered particle will be found in a certain range of
      solid angle.
    </p>
    
    <div id="cspic">
      <img width="100%" height="auto" id="mvpeimg" src="../../assets/images/res/gp/cross_section.svg" alt="Diagram for generic scattering cross section.">
    </div> 
    <p>
      The scattering amplitude of our model wave function is related to the differential cross section via the below relation.
      
      <div class="eq">
        $$
        \vert f(\phi,\theta)\vert^2=\frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega}
        $$
        </div>
    </p>
    

    <h3 id="bornapprox">Born Approximation</h3>
    <p>
      The Born approximation is a truncation of terms in the expansion of the scattering amplitude. Effectively, it's an application of <a href="https://alexheilman.com/res/gp/qapprox.html">time-dependent perturbation theory</a> to
      a central potential. It tends to work better for high energy scattering.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first order correction to the scattering amplitude in the Born series is given below as a function of incident wave vector \(\vec{k}\) and
      scattered wave vector \(\vec{k}'\).
    <div class="eq">
      $$
      \begin{align}
        f(\vec{k},\vec{k}')_B^{(1)}=-\frac{m}{2\pi \hbar^2}\int_V d\vec(x)' e^{i(\vec{k}-\vec{k}')\cdot \vec{x}'}V(\vec{x}')
      \end{align}
      $$
    </div>
    </p>

    <h3 id="partialwave">Partial Wave Analysis</h3>
    <p>
      Our approach to partial wave here is to expand both the incident and scattered waves in terms of spherical harmonics, and 
      then analyze coefficients in terms of the quantum numbers \(\ell\) and \(m\).
    </p>
    <p>
      If we take the incident quantum projectile to be a plane wave aligned with the z-axis, we may expand it's wave function in terms of spherical harmonics as below.
      <div class="eq">
      $$
        e^{ikz}=e^{ikr\cos\theta}=\sum_{\ell =0}^{\infty}(2\ell+1)i^{\ell} j_{\ell}(kr)P_{\ell}(\cos\theta )
      $$
      </div>
    </p>
    <div id="qscatt">
      <img width="100%" height="auto" id="mvpeimg" src="../../assets/images/res/gp/qscatt.svg" alt="Expected forms of wave functions for incident plane wave and spherical scattering target.">
    </div> 
    <p>
      <div class="eq">
      $$
      f(\phi,\theta)=\sum_{\ell =0}^{\infty}\sum_{m=-\ell}^{\ell}f_{\ell}^mY^m_{\ell}(\phi,\theta)
      $$
      </div>
      Now, we further take the outgoing wave resulting from the collision with the target to be a spherical wave, given by the expansion above, with some amplitude dependent on the spherical angles (centered on the target).
      Hence, we have the total wave function, as given below in spherical harmonics.
      
      <div class="eq">
      $$
      \begin{align}
      \psi(r,\theta,\phi)&=e^{ikr\cos\theta}+f(\theta,\phi) \frac{e^{ikr}}{r}\\
                         &=\sum_{\ell =0}^{\infty}\Big[(2\ell+1)i^{\ell} j_{\ell}(kr)P_{\ell}(\cos\theta )
                           +
                           f_{\ell} j_{\ell}(kr)P_{\ell}(\cos\theta )\Big]
      \end{align}
      $$
      </div>
