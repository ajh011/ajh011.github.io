        Graph neural networks are machine learning models based on artificial neural networks that take graphs as input and, in their most 
        basic arrangement, output graphs as well. Basic graph neural networks will only update graph features based on the input graph's 
        connectivity, while preserving this connectivity in the output graph. Graph neural networks are the most basic tool in the larger 
        field known as 'geometric deep learning'.

    <h2 id="graphs">Graphs</h2>
    <p>
      Graphs are mathematical structures representing objects with simple connections between them. Thus, they can be specified
      by two dimensional drawings of points (nodes) with lines (edges) between them, as below.
    </p>
    <div class="flexbox stack">
      <img class="flex" width="40%" alt="Example drawing of undirected graph" src="../../assets/images/res/ml/undgraphex.svg">
      <img class="flex" width="40%" alt="Example drawing of directed graph" src="../../assets/images/res/ml/dirgraphex.svg">
    </div>
    <p>
      Note that edges may be either directed or undirected, but an undirected graph may always be represented by a directed graph 
      with edges that all go in both directions.
    </p>
    <img class="flex smallimg" alt="Undirected edge is equivalent to bidirectional edge" src="../../assets/images/res/ml/und2dir.svg">
    <p>
      From a data perspective then, we may specify a basic graph with two sets: one of node labels, and one of ordered pairs between
      nodes. Alternatively, we can specify a graph with an adjancency matrix or a graph Laplacian, but this may be inefficient for sparse graphs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Further, while simple graphs in the mathematical sense require no extra structure than the above constructions, their application
      in the field of machine learning almost always require the association of feature vectors to the elements of the vertex or edge sets.
    </p>
    <div class="dl"></div>
    <h3 id="model">Mathematical Model</h3>
    <p>
      To be explicit, we now describe a common mathematical framework for graphs of the most elementary kind (those only with nodes and single edges betweeen them).
      We may then define a simple graph \(\mathcal{G}\) as a set of two sets: \(\mathcal{G}=\{\mathcal{V},\mathcal{E}\}\), where \(\mathcal{V}=\{v_1,...,v_n\}\) is the set of nodes or 
      vertices and \(\mathcal{E}=\{e_{ij}\}\) is the set of edges, which is a set of ordered pairs of nodes where each possible pair is either in the set or not (no repeats/multi-edges).
    </p>

    <h4>Common terminology</h4>
    <p>
      The <em>degree</em> \(\mathcal{D}(\mathcal{v})\) of a vertex \(\mathcal{v}\) in a graph is the number of edges, or equivalently the number of neighbors, connected to it. If all the vertices in a graph
      have the same number of neighbors, the graph is termed <em>regular</em>, while a graph with all possible edges is termed <em>complete</em>.
    </p>

    <h4>Adjacency matrix</h4>
    <p>
      The adjacency matrix of a graph is a clean generalization of the edge set 
      \(\mathcal{E}=\{e_{ij}\}\) to a matrix \(\mathbf{A}\) with elements

       \[a_{ij}=\delta_{e_{ij}\in\mathcal{E}}.\]

      This definition is best understood through example, as below.
    </p>
    <img class="flex smallimg" alt="Example graph with adjacency matrix" src="../../assets/images/res/ml/adjmatex.svg">
    <p>
      Adjacency matrices have several properties immediatley: they're always traceless (except in the case of hypergraphs) and they're always real. Further, undirected graphs always have real 
      symmetric adjacency matrices.
    </p>
    
    <h4>Graph Laplacian</h4>
    <p>
      The graph Laplacian is the discrete counterpart to the Laplacian of continuous spaces. It can be defined by introducing the vertex degree matrix \(\mathbf{D}\) with elements defined by
      
       <div class="flex valign">\[d_{ij}=\delta_{ij}\delta_{\mathcal{D}(\mathcal{v}_i)}.\]</div>
        <img class="flex smallimg" alt="Example graph with vertex degree matrix" src="../../assets/images/res/ml/degmatex.svg">

      

      From which we may define the graph Laplacian matrix as:

      \[\mathbf{L}=\mathbf{D}-\mathbf{A},\]

      where \(\mathbf{A}\) is the adjacency matrix.

      <img class="flex smallimg" alt="Example graph with Laplacian" src="../../assets/images/res/ml/glapex.svg">

    </p>

    <div class="dl"></div>
    <h3 id="sgt">Spectral Graph Theory</h3>
    <p>
      Spectral graph theory studies the properties of graphs through analysis of the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of
      a graph's adjacency matrix and it's graph Laplacian. For a nice overview of graphs and spectral graph theory, see
      this <a href="https://csustan.csustan.edu/~tom/Clustering/GraphLaplacian-tutorial.pdf">presentation</a> by Radu Horaud. 
    </p>
    
    <div class="dl"></div>
    <h3 id="extensions">Extensions of Graphs</h3>
    <p>
      The above structure has several clear generalizations, including multigraphs and hypergraphs which allow for multiple edges 
      in one direction between the same nodes and edges between any number of nodes, respectively. These generalizations may require
      new structures to store information about graphs.
    </p>

    <h4>Multi-Graphs</h4>
    <p>
      Multigraphs allow for multiple edges in the same direction between the same set of nodes. Hence, they may be specified still with an
      adjancency matrix (now with positive integer entries) and edge lists.
    </p>

    <h4>Hypergraphs</h4>
    <p>
      Hypergraphs allow for edges between any number of nodes. This requires we use adjacency tensors or edge sets with elements that aren't 
      neccessarily just pairs of nodes. Directed edges also need to be reconsidered, since more than one permutation of edges is possible.
    </p>

    <h2 id="gnn">Graph Neural Networks</h2>
    <p>
      Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) operate on graph inputs, generally with associated feature vectors
      and output graphs with similar connectivity but updated or 'learned' feature vectors. One layer of the simplest 
      GNN of this form is depicted below, as an example.

    <h3 id="glay">
      Simple graph layer
    </h3>
    <p>
      The graph is taken as input as each separate feature is processed by some update function, which is generally differentiable 
      (which may effectively be like an update function utilized in one node of an ANN). 
    </p>
