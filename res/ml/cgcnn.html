      <p>
        Convolutional neural nets have demonstrated an amazing efficacy in the classification of 
        highly correlated data with several layers of possible features (namely, in the application of
        image classification). Convolutional <!--<a href="https://www.alexheilman.com/res/ml/gnn.html">graph neural networks</a>--> graph neural networks or Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNN)
        have recently shown promising preliminary results that hint at a potentially strong application for the discovery

    Following notation in <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v70/gilmer17a/gilmer17a.pdf">Gilmore</a>, we can 
    describe the different forms of these MPNNs by the specific definiton of their update functions. Hover over specific variables and 
    functions below to see their definition.
    <div class="eq">
    $$
      \texttip{m^{t+1}_v}{Message to be passed to the update function with vertex v, for iteration t+1}
      =\sum_{w\in \texttip{N(v)}{Set of vertices}}\texttip{M_t}{Message function for iteration t}(\texttip{h_v^t}{"Hidden" state associated with vertex v, for iteration t},
      \texttip{h_w^t}{"Hidden" state associated with vertex w, for iteration t},\texttip{e_{vw}}{Edge vector associated with the connection between vertices v and w})
    $$
    $$
      \texttip{h_v^{t+1}}{"Hidden" state associated with vertex v, for iteration t}=
      \texttip{U_t}{Vertex update function for iteration t}(\texttip{h_v^t}{"Hidden" state associated with vertex v, for iteration t},
       \texttip{m_v^{t+1}}{Message to be passed to the update function with vertex v, for iteration t+1})
    $$

    where \(M_t\) is the message function and \(U_t\) is the vertex update function, which are to be specified in specific implementations.
  </p>

    <p>
      A relevant and recent implementation of a specfic architecture of a GCNN by Tian Xie and Jeffrey C. Grossman can be found at the following 
      <a href="https://github.com/txie-93/cgcnn">github repository</a>, corresponding with the paper  <em><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10324">Crystal 
      Graph Convolutional Neural Networks for an Accurate and Interpretable Prediction of Material Properties</a></em>. Here, the authors designed and impelemented 
      a graph convolutional neural network that could be trained to predict general properties of crystalline structures. This was achieved by converting input .cif files 
      to graphs (in an internal format) and then passing these graphs off to the network with labels (relevant to the desired predictions) for training.
    </p>

    <h2 id="crysgraph">Crystal Graphs</h2>
    <p>
      The first step in the application of GCNNs to crytalline structures is the conversion of such structures into 
      relevant and unique graph representations. This step requires the designer to make several decisions including
      what defines an edge in the crystal graph, as well as what feature vectors both edges and nodes should inherit.
    </p>
    <!--<p>
      As a hueristic, one simplified example of a crystalline unit cell being converted into a graph is depicted below, though 
      this example hides the complexity of the afforementioned decisions.
    </p>
    <img src="../../assets/images/res/ml/">-->
    <p>
      A common file format already used to work with crystalline structures is the
      Crystallographic Information File standard, saved with the extension '.cif'. As such, the data handling portion of Xie and Grossman's 
      CGCNN takes as input CIF files and outputs an internal graph structure (in relation to the recently implemented pytorch_geometric graph structure).
    </p>

    <div class="defect boxed">
      <h2 class="boxtitle">Ex: CIF to Graph Converter</h2>
      <p>
        A simple python function that converts '.cif' files to a torch_geometric graph can be found <a href="./cgcnn/cif2graph.py">here</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        This function utilizes the '.get_neighbor_list()' method inherent in pymatgen structure classes. Then, within a defined radius, edge tuples
        using the index of the '.cif' file are created, with node positions automatically associated with these nodes and distances 
        automatically associated with edges as features.
      </p>
      <p>
        The function takes as input a '.cif' file's address as a string and returns a torch_geometric graph object with the attributes listed above.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>CGCNN Architecture</h2>
    <p>
      The architecture of the CGCNN is relatively simple: it consists of an input layer that recieves the chosen graph representations; \(R\) convolutional layers;
      a hidden layer \(L_1\)(fully connected); one pooling layer; and then another hidden layer \(L_2\); which feeds into the output layer, which is a single node. 
    </p>
    <h3>Convolutional Layers</h3>
    <p>
      The convolutional layers in the CGCNN model generally utilized one of two convolutional functions, described below. The equation numbering 
      of the article is included below for reference.
      <div class="eq">
        \[\vec{v}^{(t+1)}_i=g\left[\left(\sum_{j,k}\vec{v}_j^{(t)}\oplus\vec{v}_{(i,j)_k}\right)\mathbf{W}^{(t)}_{c}
        +\vec{v}^{(t)}_{s}\mathbf{W}^{(t)}_{s}+\vec{b}^{(t)}\right] \quad (4)\]
        \[\vec{v}^{(t+1)}_i=\vec{v}^{(t)}_i+\sum_{j,k}\sigma\left[\vec{z}_{(i,j)_k}^{(t)}\mathbf{W}_f+\vec{b}_f^{(t)}\right]
        \odot g\left[\vec{z}_{(i,j)_k}^{(t)}\mathbf{W}_s+\vec{b}^{(t)}_{s}\right]\quad (5)\]
      </div>
    </p>
    <h3>Pooling Layers</h3>
    <p>
      The pooling layers in the CGCNN model then followed from the choice of convolutional function, with the two used variants described below.
      However, both were forms of normalized summation. 
      These normalized mean layers have the advantage of drawing information from the whole of the given cell, but comes with the disadvantage of 
      effectively normalizing the infleunce of each site. 
      <div class="eq">
        \[\vec{v}_c=\sum_{i,t}\text{Softmax}(\mathbf{W}_t\vec{v}_i^{(t)}+\vec{b}_t)\quad\text{for}\ (4)\]
        \[\vec{v}_c=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i}\vec{v}_i^{(R)}\quad\quad\text{for}\ (5)\]
      </div>
      Note that the first pooling function sums over the output feature vectors from every convolutional layer,
      whereas the second choice only need sum over the last convolutional layers learned vectors. 
    </p>

    <br>
    <div class="defect boxed">
    <h2 class="boxtitle">Classification of Point Defects</h2>
    <p>
      An interesting question in this avenue is whether these CGCNN models can distiguish and classify
      defect structures from perfect crystalline structures.
    </p>
    <h3>Generating Data</h3>
    <p>
      Defect data was generated using certain utilities in the python package pymatgen, as well as modified versions of custom defined 
      python functions created by Debajit Chakraborty.
    </p>
    <p>
      For simplicity, we consider only point defects initially. These defects were created for randomly chosen cells of the C2DB materials 
      database. The point defect structures considered are covered below.
    </p>
    <h4>Defect Structures</h4>
    <div class="flexbox stack">
      <img class="flex sbox" alt="Example substitution point defect" src="../../assets/images/res/ml/substitution.svg">
      <img class="flex sbox" alt="Example vacancy point defect" src="../../assets/images/res/ml/vacancy.svg">
      <img class="flex sbox" alt="Example antisite point defect" src="../../assets/images/res/ml/antisite.svg">
      <img class="flex sboxe" alt="Example interstitial point defect" src="../../assets/images/res/ml/interstitial.svg">
    </div>

    <p>
      Four common types of point defects in crystalline solids are interstitial, vacancy, antisite, and substitution defects. Point defects are specified at a single point
      and as such may be isolated to one point of the structure. Given their simple and localized nature, they are a natural starting point for training.
    </p>
    <h4>Pooling Layer</h4>
    <p>
      Due to the localized nature of the point defects, the normalized sum function previously utilized in the CGCNN paper
      proved very ineffective, as the contributing sites defining the defect were drowned out by the influence of the several other points.
      To this end, a max pooling layer was implemented instead, defined below.
      <!--<div class="eq">
        \[\vec{v}_c=\text{Max}({\vec{v}_i})\]
      </div>-->
    </p>
    <p>
      A comparison of results for both the vanilla pooling layer (mean) and the new max pooling layer is provided in the test results below.
    </p>
    <h3>Test Results</h3>
    <p>
      Best test results for the CGCNN being trained as a classifier for single sets of defects (labelled with 1) and perfect 
      supercells of the same size (labelled with 0) is reported in the table below. The data was partitioned into a 50/50 data set with as many defective supercells as
      perfect supercells for testing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Training was done for 30 epochs with a radius of 8 (units?) and a maximum number of considered neighbors of 12. Feature 
      vectors for the atoms was inhereted from the 'atom_init.json' file of the sample data provided in the CGCNN github repository.

  <p>
    Clearly, the CGCNN performed better with the replaced max pooling layer.
