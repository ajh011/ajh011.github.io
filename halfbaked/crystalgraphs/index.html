                                        Below, the representation of crystalline structures as graphs, a model often for input into networks trained for
                                        material property prediction, is discussed. We neglect treatment of the networks 
                                        themselves to focus on the schemes of graph encoding.
                                    </p> 

                                    <p class="drop-cap">
                                       Modern machine learning models applied to the prediction of material properties from crystalline structures 
                                       depict such crystalline structures as graphs. In these graphs, nodes represent
                                       atoms and edges represent some general bond between or pairing of atoms. The construction of these graphs 
                                       then requires us to define, at minimum, some criteria for the construction of edges. 
                                       Often, the edges are just made for the 12 nearest neigbors; or based upon some distance cut-off.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Such a basic model of these crystalline structures obviously includes no substantial atomic information, and hence 
                                        doesn't have enough physical information for any downstream model to perform well in most predictive tasks.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        To resolve this, both nodes and edges in these graphs then each have some additional 'hidden' feature vector or 'representation' that 
                                        describes the physical characteristics of it's corresponding graph element. Generally, these initial features are derived from known properties 
                                        of the element's corresponding physical state; and then updated via some graph convolutional network. The output of the network 
                                        then is some 'learned representation' of the crystal structure (generally after the pooling of node features). This learned representation 
                                        is then used as input for some (trained) predictive neural network.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Below, we discuss the usual schemes of graph encoding, along with their included feature schemes, employed in some famous crystal graph convolutional networks 
                                        (CGCNNs). Then, we consider limitations of the models and discuss a possible extension of the framework.
                                    </p>
                                    <h2>Crystal Graphs</h2>

                                        The mathematical object known generally as a <em>graph</em> is just a set of nodes (or vertices) and a set of edges between them.
                                        They may be represented diagrammatically rather nicely, with one displayed below:


                                        They also may be decribed explicitly as a set of two sets: one set of nodes \(\mathcal{V}\); and one set of tuples \(\mathcal{E}\), denoting an edge between two nodes in the previous set.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        For the matter at hand, we'll use this basic structure as a framework for the mathematical representation of crystalline strucutres. 
                                        And then, we attach some sort of representation to the constituent elements in a way that encodes the physical information of the system.
                                    </p>

                                        For the underlying graph we can simply take the atoms to be the nodes, but then edges must be constructed according to some 
                                        criteria. That is, the nodes obviously can be taken as the atomic sites of the lattice, but we need to define explicitly what
                                        an edge between two nodes represents. Below, some of these criteria for edge construction are discussed, with specific criteria from 
                                        previous works being used as examples.

                                    <h3>Edge Criteria</h3>
                                    <p>

                                        Most of the edge criteria employed are very basic, and consider only distance. This is to effectively maintain 
                                        generality of task and to minimize computational complexity (perhaps as well as intellectual). These criteria are crude, 
                                        but proven to work with modern CGCNNs rather well.

                                        While these methods are particularly

                                    <h4>Distance Cut-off</h4>
                                    <p>

                                        Distance cut-off is one of the most common approaches. The interatomic cut-off is often in the range of 5-10 Angstroms. 
                                        The difference in distance is then accounted for in the associated edge features.

                                        Sometimes a protocol calls for a certain number of neighbors for every node. This may always be accomplished in crystalline 
                                        structures by assuming periodicity and including those within neighboring cells (if there aren't enough in a single unit cell).

                                    <h2>Initial Features</h2>
                                    <p>
                                        With a graph in hand, we now need a way to associate the important phyiscal information of the crystal with the graph. 
                                        This is done by associating a vector, termed the feature vector, with each node, and often edge, of the graph. The feature vectors 
                                        are intended to encode the relevant physical data for the chosen predictive task.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Note that we term these initial features, since they are usually as input for some machine learning model. 
                                        Having acknowledged this, we now drop the term initial in the following 
                                        discussions.

                                        We now consider the features of the two objects: the atoms or nodes; and the edges.
                                    </p>
                                    <h3>Node/Atom Features</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        Nodes of the crystal graph represent atoms most usually, so we may essentially consider this to be a discussion of 
                                        atom representation vectors.
                                    </p>

                                        Of course, atoms have corresponding valence charges, differing orbital structures, and groups. A common 
                                        scheme for atom representation vectors is that employed in the classic CGCNN by Xie & Grossman. This is described
                                        succinctly in the diagram below:

                                        Note that some values are one-hot encoded; others are expansions, etc. The implementation of the scheme above can be found as

                                            place a zero or one to describe this true-false relationship. Alternatively, to increase the dimensionality, we could have an
                                            inefficient two-dimensional space where either of the two must be one, with the first being one and the other zero (denoting true) and 
                                            then vice versa (denoting false) being the only two options.

                                            This also may be used to describe a set of mutually-exclusive categories.

                                            One-hot encoding is inefficient, but, it may help communicate better the 
                                            different classes to the model it's input in to. This is especially true, considering that the first layers
                                            may act just as linear maps.

                                    <h3>Edge/"Bond" Features</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        Apparently, due to their simple criteria for construction, the feature vector of most crystal graph edges 
                                        is only based upon distance. One could also conceivably include other information about the bond, such as the combined charge or combined electrostatic valency of the 
                                        neighbors, but this then wouldn't apply to next nearest neighbors very well, or the next next etc. which may have been included in the edge construction.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        We can always describe a distance as a scalar distance, but we may also 
                                        describe it as an offset vector (though there is some ambiguity up to a minus sign).  
                                        More frequently, the scalar distance corresponding to the edge is expanded in a so-called Gaussian distance expansion, or Radial-Basis Function 
                                        expansion (RBF). This gives us a larger dimensional representation vector based only on the distance.

                                    <p>
                                        Of course, the loose definition of an edge also requires us to drop the interpretation of the edges as direct bonds 
                                        between graph neighbors.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        The major flaw with these techniques is their lack of inclusion of larger geometrical information. Then again, the high performance of 
                                        such models without this geometrical information may be a testament to it's neglible effect on the chosen targets.
