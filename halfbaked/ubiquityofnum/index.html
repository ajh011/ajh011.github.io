                                    Given that the reals are a unique set of objects defined by certain properties, anything that can be modeled by
                                    them is neccessarily exhibiting those defining properties.</p> 

                                    <p class="drop-cap">
                                    Real numbers are the unique complete ordered field. In the next section we'll formally lay out what 
                                    this means; but, for now, we'll provide some motivation for our current considerations. If some physical
                                    system can in some way be modeled by the real numbers, then we'll refer to said system as a <em>physical instance</em> of
                                    the reals. These instances neccessarily exhibit the same properties as the reals, meaning they have some 
                                    sense of order and completeness, as well as some operations between elements of the instance that behave nicely.
                                    Furthermore, any theorem or mathematical machinery applicable to the reals should also apply to true physical
                                    instances of them, namely the tools of calculus and other constructions on these basic elements. So do these 
                                    instances really exhibit all the properties we would expect, and if not, where do they fail?
                                    </p>

            
            
                                    <h2>Defining Properties of the Reals</h2>
            
                                    <p>
                                    It's hard to talk about the reals without mentioning the operations between them. In fact,
                                    they're probably useless without these operations. The reals can be defined as the unique complete
                                    ordered abelian group, where the group action is simple addition. Then with multiplication 
                                    (and it's discrete relation to addition), we get a field for free.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                    For the topic at hand, it's most advatageous to consider an axiomatization of the reals, as opposed to a 
                                    construction of them, as this facilitates our discussion of properties.
                                    </p>

                                    Let's consider some explicit scenarios where the reals are often used in real life. A classic example is
                                    measuring time for some duration or computing volumes of liquids. But, the reals also have applications
                                    in probability and economics. 
                                    </p>

                                    <h2>Inherited Problems</h2>
            
                                    <p>
                                    Perhaps the most complex, and certainly the hardest to define, characteristic of the reals is that of completeness.
                                    In fact, one of the greatest challenges in axiomatic constructions for the numbers we know and love is the jump from 
                                    algebraic numbers to the complete set of the reals. This jump requires, in some constructions, the use of Dedekind cuts.
                                    Alternatively, in the form of an axiom, we can state this property in terms of Cauchy sequences; that is, for every Cauchy
                                    sequence that is a subset of the reals, the limits of such sequences are also included in the reals.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                    With this complexity, we also get a good bit of what one may call continuity baggage. Uncomputable numbers raise a particular problem
                                    for out physical instance of the reals: if we can never compute certain numbers (such as infinitesimals), then we surely
                                    can never measure such a number in our physical apparatus. This seems to imply we have some more structure in our mathematical 
                                    model than may be warranted. In other words, it seems we can't have any real instances of the reals.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                    If we consider again the idea of some volume of water, we know for certain (now) that there's some minimum 
                                    unit of water. Thus, we can't infinitely divide it and we certainly don't satisfy the completeness property
                                    of the reals. Even something as abstract as economics has a lowest unit, namely
                                    for USD, the penny. And other, perhaps moral, problems may be found with the apparent linear ordering of the worth
                                    of things, inherited from the monetary value of goods. For instance, a family heirloom may appear worthless if only 
                                    because it's monetary value is near nothing.
                                    </p>

                                    This completeness isn't as easily cast off as we might imagine, however. Completeness is a requirement for 
                                    the applicability of calculus, a tool oft used in physical instances of the reals. So, then what ever could replace
                                    such an indispensible tool? I'm not sure.
