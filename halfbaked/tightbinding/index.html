                                       The Hamiltonian is the mathematical object that completely defines the time evolution of a physical system.
                                       For closed systems, it also gives us the total energy of a state. Assuming that the system is closed and that
                                       all forces acting on the system are conservative, we may then assume 
                                       the Hamiltonian is simply the sum of the kinetic and potential energies of all constituent particles.
                                    </p>

                                        Recalling the form of classical kinetic energy for a particle of mass \(m\), and momentum \(p=mv\)
                                        we may give the slighlty more informative, yet still general form of the classical Hamiltonian:
                                        <div class="eq">
                                            \[
                                            H=T+V = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 + V(r) = \frac{p^2}{2m}+V(r)
                                            \]
                                        </div>
                                        where \(V(r)\) represents a potential field which depends on position, and corresponds to an arbitrary (conservative)
                                        force or set of forces acting on the system.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Now that we have a general form in mind, we'll first consider what we care about in the modeling of crystalline 
                                        systems. Then, we'll build a useful form for a Hamiltonian describing crystalline systems in which 
                                        electrons are effectively confined to the lattice sites and only interact with their nearest neighbors.

                                    <p>
                                        When modeling material systems, we first need to determine what, exactly, 
                                        we need to consider to capture the material properties of the system. Put more simply:
                                        what do we really care about when considering solid state systems?
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        In solid state, the most interesting steady-state dynamical properties, such as electrical and 
                                        thermal conductivity, tend to depend mostly on the electrons. In fact,
                                        in many systems, we need only consider the behaviour of the electrons to 
                                        decribe these phenomena to a good approximation. [Disclaimer: Other factors may also
                                        have large influence, but here we intend to simplify matters and approximate; see e.g. quasi-particles]
                                    </p>

                                        As such, we leave the ionic lattice, with nuclei at each site, in the background. We then only consider the electron's dynamics
                                        under the effect of some periodic potential, corresponding to the lattice's effects.

                                        Below, we first give a review of the first and second quantized free-electron Hamiltonians, and 
                                        then build the analogous Hamiltonians for electrons constrained to a background lattice.

                                        In the case of the free-electron, we have no potential energy and essentially have only a kinetic 
                                        term in the Hamiltonian:
                                        <div class="eq">
                                            \[
                                                H=\frac{1}{2}mv^2=\frac{p^2}{2m}
                                            \]
                                        </div>
                                        This is the classical form of the free electron's Hamiltonian. However, in modern considerations,
                                        we know we need to account for quantum mechanical effects to better desrcribe the dynamics of the 
                                        system.

                                    <p>
                                        Now in the framework of first quantization, we promote variables, such as 
                                        position, \(x\), and momentum, \(p\), to operators which act on states of the system.
                                        In position space, they take the form below:
                                        <div class="eq">
                                            \[
                                                p\rightarrow -i\hbar \vec{\nabla}\quad\quad\quad x\rightarrow \hat{x}
                                            \]
                                        </div>
                                        where \( \vec{\nabla}\) is the position-space gradient of the state being acted on, whereas
                                        \(\hat{x}\) returns the position vector of the state it acts on.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        This gives us the well-known form for the quantum mechanical free-electron Hamiltonian 
                                        (as an operator on position space) as follows:
                                        <div class="eq">
                                            \[\hat{H}=-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\nabla^2\]
                                        </div>

                                        Now, applying the Schrodinger Equation to the 
                                        position-basis electron wavefunction, we may easily determine
                                        the eigenstates of this Hamiltonian, as 
                                        sketched below:

                                            \Rightarrow \quad \psi_{\vec{p}}(\vec{r},t)=Ae^{-i(\vec{r}\cdot \vec{p}-E t)/\hbar}

                                        </div>
                                        where the eigenvalues of eigenstates \(\psi_{\vec{p}}\) are determined by their momentum \(\vec{p}\), since 
                                        each's energy is \(p^2/2m\).

                                        Further setting \(\omega=E/\hbar\) and \(\vec{k}=\vec{p}/\hbar\), we may simplify a bit to arrive 
                                        at the expression for a free electron's energy (now determined by it's \(k\) value):

                                        Now we have a nice form for the dispersion relation of a free electron. But, we still have a somewhat ugly 
                                        Hamiltonian that requires us to take derivatives with respect to position (though these are admittedly easy 
                                        in the basis we've presented). We now seek a more sophisticated form of the Hamiltonian which simply 
                                        'counts' the energy of the system, piece by piece.

                                        In second-quantized formalisms or, equivalently, the occupation number representation, we represent particles 
                                        as operators on the vacuum state (think creation and annihilation operators a la the QHO). 
                                        In lieu of a deep discussion of second-quantization, we defer interested parties to other articles, and review only the 
                                        most basic and relevant concepts here.

                                        For some state defined by good quantum numbers (here \(\vec{k}\), but this may also include a spin state \(\sigma\), etc.), 
                                        we have a unique pair of a creation and annihilation operator: (\(\hat{a}^{\dagger}_{\vec{k}},\hat{a}_{\vec{k}}\)), respectively. These 
                                        act on the particle number basis (Fock) states as shown below:

                                        may leave the above false up to a minus sign if different operators are concatenated]

                                        We may compose these two operators of each pair to construct a number operator that also has an eigenbasis 
                                        coinciding with the particle number basis, with eigenvalues representing the number of particles in each state.
                                        Explicity, we construct the number operator for a state defined by \(\vec{k}\) to be:

                                        Note that for Fermions, such as electrons, the number operator \( \hat{n}_{\vec{k}}\)
                                        may only return 0 or 1 for each \(\vec{k}\).

                                        Considering this, we may now compose a new form of the free-electron Hamiltonian (or really any Hamiltonian in 
                                        a good basis for it's eigenspace), as given below:

                                        This may look scary, but it's action really is more intuitive: for every 
                                        possible energy state of the system we simply see if there's a particle in that state, and if there is, we 
                                        add it's energy to the total energy.

                                        Now, for electrons tightly bound to their positions on the underlying lattice, we may imagine these electrons are no longer constrained
                                        in \(k\)-space, but now are constrained to certain lattice sites (or one of several orbitals localized at each lattice site) in real space.

                                        In this scenario, momentum is no longer a good quantum number. However, the lattice position \(i\) (where \(\vec{r}_i\) is a lattice vector) now is a good quantum 
                                        number, since each electron has a unique lattice position or orbital in real space.

                                        In the most extreme case of localization (where electron's position-space wavefunctions, or Wannier functions, may be 
                                        taken to not overlap at all between lattice positions), there will be no interaction between different sites. And hence, if all lattice sites are equivalent, 
                                        and each site has a bond strength of \( u_{site} \), the Hamiltonian takes the following form:

                                        Again, using the intuition gained from the construction of the second-quantized free-electron Hamiltonian, we may then consider
                                        the form of such a nearest neighbors term of the Hamiltonian, which naturally acts on a particle number representation corresponding 
                                        to specfic lattice sites, as below. 
                                        <div class="eq">

                                        the set of nearest neighbor sites \(i,j\). Then, \(t\), often termed the hopping parameter, corresponds to the interaction energy 
                                        between nearest neighbors. Note that here we've assumed interactions are isotropic and uniform (such that all sites are equivalent).

                                        To understand this form further, let's consider the first term above, \(-t\hat{a}^{\dagger}_{j}\hat{a}_{i}\). This term corresponds to a particle at 
                                        site \(i\) being destroyed and one at site \(j\) being created, effectively accounting for an electron that 'hops' from site 
                                        \(i \) to site \(j\) and gaining energy \(t\). However, if one electron is already at site \(j\ (n_j=1)\), this cannot happen and the contribution 
                                        from the term will be zero.

                                            One may wonder why we need to include the second term (\(\hat{a}^{\dagger}_{i}\hat{a}_{j}\)) when we have the first (\(\hat{a}^{\dagger}_{j}\hat{a}_{i}\)). 
                                            Recall that Hamiltonians must be Hermitian. Also recall that any non-Hermitian operator may be transformed into 
                                            a Hermitian operator by defining a new operator that is the sum of itself and it's Hermitian conjugate:

                                            Hence, if we simply include, always, the Hermitian conjugate of the form of the term we care to model, we 
                                            are guaranteed to have a Hermitian Hamiltonian. To be explicit, for the case of nearest neightbors, the term

                                            the resulting operator is guaranteed to be Hermitian. The addition of just the 
                                            term \(h.c.\) to denote this scheme is standard practice in applications of the models

                                        and that the only interaction is between states directly next to each other, where the likelihood of transition/energy

                                        For a tightly-bound system of electrons constrained to some underlying lattice, we may then approximate the Hamiltonian 
                                        to be the sum of the two Hamiltonians considered above.
                                        <div class="eq">
                                            \[
                                            \hat{H}_{tight-binding} = \hat{H}_{sites}+\hat{H}_{n.n.}

                                        Thus, we can intuit that this tight-binding model succintly describes the energy and dynamics of a situation in which 
                                        neighboring electrons interact by  transitioning into other states or lattice sites. It also accounts for the site's energies themselves.

                                        be neglected in considerations of dynamics.

                                        Of course this truncation to nearest neighbor interactions is usually just an approximation (it's not impossible that the Wannier functions don't overlap 
                                        on a larger scale). Some materials require us to include further range terms;

                                        The form of the tight-binding Hamiltonian given above tends to be a more appropriate model for insulating 
                                        systems, as they tend to have more localized electrons.

                                        Recall, from Bloch's theorem, that the wavefunction of an electron constrained to a periodic lattice 
                                        satisfying certain boundary conditions (Periodic/Bloch-Karman) may be decomposed into a product of 
                                        a plane wave and a periodic function (with a period corresponding to the lattice spacing). Explicity, 
                                        Bloch states guarantee we have the following form of wavefunctions in (perfect/ideal) crystalline systems:
                                        <div class="eq">
                                            \[
                                               \psi(\vec{R}+\vec{r})=e^{-i\vec{p}\cdot\vec{R}}\psi(\vec{r})
                                            \]
                                        </div>
                                        where \(\vec{R}\) is a Bravais lattice vector. Note that the periodic boundary conditions also constrain the possible values 
                                        of \(\vec{p}\) to be reciprocal lattice vectors.
                                    </p>
                                    </div>-->

                                        Note that the point of this article was only to provide some rationale and justification of the real-space form 
                                        of the tight-binding Hamiltonian in a second-quantized form. This real-space force can be converted into a 
                                        momentum-space form, from which we may extract a dispersion relation, by inserting the Fourier transform of 
                                        the creation and annihilation operators. In this case we would end up with a diagonal form in \(k\)-space of \(H\):
                                        <div class="eq">
                                            \[
                                            \vec{H} = \sum_{\vec{k}}^{B.Z.}\epsilon (\vec{k})\hat{a}^{\dagger}_{\vec{k}}\hat{a}_{\vec{k}}
                                            \]
                                        </div>
                                        where \(\epsilon(\vec{k})\) is the dispersion relation, and details the band structure of the system (the sum is over Bloch 
                                        wave vectors in the first Brillouin Zone).

                                        The second-quantized tight-binding model is often a first example for more contemporary treatments such as 
                                        the t-J and Hubbard model, as well as the Hofstadter model. Interactions between more than two sites at a time, with terms of the 
                                        form \(a^{\dagger}_ja^{\dagger}_ka_ia_j\) and larger, are also possible but neglected here.
