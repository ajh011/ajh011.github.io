abstract={We present a benchmark test suite and an automated machine learning procedure for evaluating supervised machine learning (ML) models for predicting properties of inorganic bulk materials. The test suite, Matbench, is a set of 13{\thinspace}ML tasks that range in size from 312 to 132k samples and contain data from 10 density functional theory-derived and experimental sources. Tasks include predicting optical, thermal, electronic, thermodynamic, tensile, and elastic properties given a material's composition and/or crystal structure. The reference algorithm, Automatminer, is a highly-extensible, fully automated ML pipeline for predicting materials properties from materials primitives (such as composition and crystal structure) without user intervention or hyperparameter tuning. We test Automatminer on the Matbench test suite and compare its predictive power with state-of-the-art crystal graph neural networks and a traditional descriptor-based Random Forest model. We find Automatminer achieves the best performance on 8 of 13 tasks in the benchmark. We also show our test suite is capable of exposing predictive advantages of each algorithm---namely, that crystal graph methods appear to outperform traditional machine learning methods given {\textasciitilde}104 or greater data points. We encourage evaluating materials ML algorithms on the Matbench benchmark and comparing them against the latest version of Automatminer.},

abstract={Crystalline materials have atomic-scale fluctuations in their chemical composition that modulate various mesoscale properties. Establishing chemistry--microstructure relationships in such materials requires proper characterization of these chemical fluctuations. Yet, current characterization approaches (e.g., Warren--Cowley parameters) make only partial use of the complete chemical and structural information contained in local chemical motifs. Here we introduce a framework based on E(3)-equivariant graph neural networks that is capable of completely identifying chemical motifs in arbitrary crystalline structures with any number of chemical elements. This approach naturally leads to a proper information-theoretic measure for quantifying chemical short-range order (SRO) in chemically complex materials and a reduced representation of the chemical motif space. Our framework enables the correlation of any per-atom property with their corresponding local chemical motif, thereby enabling the exploration of structure--property relationships in chemically complex materials. Using the MoTaNbTi high-entropy alloy as a test system, we demonstrate the versatility of this approach by evaluating the lattice strain associated with each chemical motif, and computing the temperature dependence of chemical-fluctuations length scale.},

Traditional experiments and calculations often waste large amounts of time and money and are also limited by various conditions. Therefore, it is imperative to develop a new method to accelerate the discovery and design of new materials. In recent years, material discovery and design methods using machine learning have attracted much attention from material experts and have made some progress. This review first outlines available materials database and material data analytics tools and then elaborates on the machine learning algorithms used in materials science. Next, the field of application of machine learning in materials science is summarized, focusing on the aspects of structure determination, performance prediction, fingerprint prediction, and new material discovery. Finally, the review points out the problems of data and machine learning in materials science and points to future research. Using machine learning algorithms, the authors hope to achieve amazing results in material discovery and design.}
