abstract={We present a benchmark test suite and an automated machine learning procedure for evaluating supervised machine learning (ML) models for predicting properties of inorganic bulk materials. The test suite, Matbench, is a set of 13{\thinspace}ML tasks that range in size from 312 to 132k samples and contain data from 10 density functional theory-derived and experimental sources. Tasks include predicting optical, thermal, electronic, thermodynamic, tensile, and elastic properties given a material's composition and/or crystal structure. The reference algorithm, Automatminer, is a highly-extensible, fully automated ML pipeline for predicting materials properties from materials primitives (such as composition and crystal structure) without user intervention or hyperparameter tuning. We test Automatminer on the Matbench test suite and compare its predictive power with state-of-the-art crystal graph neural networks and a traditional descriptor-based Random Forest model. We find Automatminer achieves the best performance on 8 of 13 tasks in the benchmark. We also show our test suite is capable of exposing predictive advantages of each algorithm---namely, that crystal graph methods appear to outperform traditional machine learning methods given {\textasciitilde}104 or greater data points. We encourage evaluating materials ML algorithms on the Matbench benchmark and comparing them against the latest version of Automatminer.},

Machine learning, in general, and deep learning, in particular, are ideally suitable for representing quantum-mechanical interactions, enabling us to model nonlinear potential-energy surfaces or enhancing the exploration of chemical compound space. Here we present the deep learning architecture SchNet that is specifically designed to model atomistic systems by making use of continuous-filter convolutional layers. We demonstrate the capabilities of SchNet by accurately predicting a range of properties across chemical space for molecules and materials, where our model learns chemically plausible embeddings of atom types across the periodic table. Finally, we employ SchNet to predict potential-energy surfaces and energy-conserving force fields for molecular dynamics simulations of small molecules and perform an exemplary study on the quantum-mechanical properties of C20-fullerene that would have been infeasible with regular ab initio molecular dynamics.},

abstract={This study presents a new machine learning algorithm, named Chemical Environment Graph Neural Network (ChemGNN), designed to accelerate materials property prediction and advance new materials discovery. Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) and its doped variants have gained significant interest for their potential as optical materials. Accurate prediction of their band gaps is crucial for practical applications; however, traditional quantum simulation methods are computationally expensive and challenging to explore the vast space of possible doped molecular structures. The proposed ChemGNN leverages the learning ability of current graph neural networks (GNNs) to satisfactorily capture the characteristics of atoms' chemical environment underlying complex molecular structures. Our experimental results demonstrate more than 100{\%} improvement in band gap prediction accuracy over existing GNNs on g-C3N4. Furthermore, the general ChemGNN model can precisely foresee band gaps of various doped g-C3N4 structures, making it a valuable tool for performing high-throughput prediction in materials design and development.},

abstract={Crystalline materials have atomic-scale fluctuations in their chemical composition that modulate various mesoscale properties. Establishing chemistry--microstructure relationships in such materials requires proper characterization of these chemical fluctuations. Yet, current characterization approaches (e.g., Warren--Cowley parameters) make only partial use of the complete chemical and structural information contained in local chemical motifs. Here we introduce a framework based on E(3)-equivariant graph neural networks that is capable of completely identifying chemical motifs in arbitrary crystalline structures with any number of chemical elements. This approach naturally leads to a proper information-theoretic measure for quantifying chemical short-range order (SRO) in chemically complex materials and a reduced representation of the chemical motif space. Our framework enables the correlation of any per-atom property with their corresponding local chemical motif, thereby enabling the exploration of structure--property relationships in chemically complex materials. Using the MoTaNbTi high-entropy alloy as a test system, we demonstrate the versatility of this approach by evaluating the lattice strain associated with each chemical motif, and computing the temperature dependence of chemical-fluctuations length scale.},

Traditional experiments and calculations often waste large amounts of time and money and are also limited by various conditions. Therefore, it is imperative to develop a new method to accelerate the discovery and design of new materials. In recent years, material discovery and design methods using machine learning have attracted much attention from material experts and have made some progress. This review first outlines available materials database and material data analytics tools and then elaborates on the machine learning algorithms used in materials science. Next, the field of application of machine learning in materials science is summarized, focusing on the aspects of structure determination, performance prediction, fingerprint prediction, and new material discovery. Finally, the review points out the problems of data and machine learning in materials science and points to future research. Using machine learning algorithms, the authors hope to achieve amazing results in material discovery and design.}
