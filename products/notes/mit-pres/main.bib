abstract={We present a benchmark test suite and an automated machine learning procedure for evaluating supervised machine learning (ML) models for predicting properties of inorganic bulk materials. The test suite, Matbench, is a set of 13{\thinspace}ML tasks that range in size from 312 to 132k samples and contain data from 10 density functional theory-derived and experimental sources. Tasks include predicting optical, thermal, electronic, thermodynamic, tensile, and elastic properties given a material's composition and/or crystal structure. The reference algorithm, Automatminer, is a highly-extensible, fully automated ML pipeline for predicting materials properties from materials primitives (such as composition and crystal structure) without user intervention or hyperparameter tuning. We test Automatminer on the Matbench test suite and compare its predictive power with state-of-the-art crystal graph neural networks and a traditional descriptor-based Random Forest model. We find Automatminer achieves the best performance on 8 of 13 tasks in the benchmark. We also show our test suite is capable of exposing predictive advantages of each algorithm---namely, that crystal graph methods appear to outperform traditional machine learning methods given {\textasciitilde}104 or greater data points. We encourage evaluating materials ML algorithms on the Matbench benchmark and comparing them against the latest version of Automatminer.},

abstract={The piezoelectric materials enable the mutual conversion between mechanical and electrical energy, which drive a multi-billion dollar industry through their applications as sensors, actuators, and energy harvesters. The third-rank piezoelectric tensor is the core matrices for piezoelectric materials and their devices. However, the high costs of obtaining full piezoelectric tensor data through either experimental or computational methods make a significant challenge. Here, we propose an equivariant attention tensor graph neural network (EATGNN) that can identify crystal symmetry and remain independent of the reference frame, ultimately enabling the accurate prediction of the complete third-rank piezoelectric tensor. Especially, we perform an irreducible decomposition of the piezoelectric tensor into four irreducible representations to efficiently reserve the symmetry under group transformation operations. Our results further demonstrate that this model performs well in both bulk and two-dimensional materials. Finally, combining EATGNN with first-principles calculations, we discovered several potential high-performance piezoelectric materials.},

abstract={This work presents Neural Equivariant Interatomic Potentials (NequIP), an E(3)-equivariant neural network approach for learning interatomic potentials from ab-initio calculations for molecular dynamics simulations. While most contemporary symmetry-aware models use invariant convolutions and only act on scalars, NequIP employs E(3)-equivariant convolutions for interactions of geometric tensors, resulting in a more information-rich and faithful representation of atomic environments. The method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on a challenging and diverse set of molecules and materials while exhibiting remarkable data efficiency. NequIP outperforms existing models with up to three orders of magnitude fewer training data, challenging the widely held belief that deep neural networks require massive training sets. The high data efficiency of the method allows for the construction of accurate potentials using high-order quantum chemical level of theory as reference and enables high-fidelity molecular dynamics simulations over long time scales.},

abstract={Crystalline materials have atomic-scale fluctuations in their chemical composition that modulate various mesoscale properties. Establishing chemistry--microstructure relationships in such materials requires proper characterization of these chemical fluctuations. Yet, current characterization approaches (e.g., Warren--Cowley parameters) make only partial use of the complete chemical and structural information contained in local chemical motifs. Here we introduce a framework based on E(3)-equivariant graph neural networks that is capable of completely identifying chemical motifs in arbitrary crystalline structures with any number of chemical elements. This approach naturally leads to a proper information-theoretic measure for quantifying chemical short-range order (SRO) in chemically complex materials and a reduced representation of the chemical motif space. Our framework enables the correlation of any per-atom property with their corresponding local chemical motif, thereby enabling the exploration of structure--property relationships in chemically complex materials. Using the MoTaNbTi high-entropy alloy as a test system, we demonstrate the versatility of this approach by evaluating the lattice strain associated with each chemical motif, and computing the temperature dependence of chemical-fluctuations length scale.},

Traditional experiments and calculations often waste large amounts of time and money and are also limited by various conditions. Therefore, it is imperative to develop a new method to accelerate the discovery and design of new materials. In recent years, material discovery and design methods using machine learning have attracted much attention from material experts and have made some progress. This review first outlines available materials database and material data analytics tools and then elaborates on the machine learning algorithms used in materials science. Next, the field of application of machine learning in materials science is summarized, focusing on the aspects of structure determination, performance prediction, fingerprint prediction, and new material discovery. Finally, the review points out the problems of data and machine learning in materials science and points to future research. Using machine learning algorithms, the authors hope to achieve amazing results in material discovery and design.}

G-CNNs use G-convolutions, a new type of layer that enjoys a substantially higher degree of weight sharing than regular convolution layers. G-convolutions increase the expressive capacity of the network without increasing the number of parameters. Group convolution layers are easy to use and can be implemented with negligible computational overhead for discrete groups generated by translations, reflections and rotations. G-CNNs achieve state of the art results on CIFAR10 and rotated MNIST.}

Equivariance is important to ensure stable and predictable performance in the presence of nuisance transformations of the data input. A positive corollary of equivariance is increased weight-tying within the model. The SE(3)-Transformer leverages the benefits of self-attention to operate on large point clouds and graphs with varying number of points, while guaranteeing SE(3)-equivariance for robustness. We evaluate our model on a toy N-body particle simulation dataset, showcasing the robustness of the predictions under rotations of the input. We further achieve competitive performance on two real-world datasets, ScanObjectNN and QM9. In all cases, our model outperforms a strong, non-equivariant attention baseline and an equivariant model without attention.},

Considerable attention has recently been devoted to generating stable crystal structures. While existing work has shown impressive success on supervised tasks such as property prediction, the progress on unsupervised tasks such as material generation is still hampered by the limited extent to which the equivalent geometric representations of the same crystal are considered. To address this challenge, we propose EMPNN a periodic equivariant message-passing neural network that learns crystal lattice deformation in an unsupervised fashion. Our model equivalently acts on lattice according to the deformation action that must be performed, making it suitable for crystal generation, relaxation and optimisation. We present experimental evaluations that demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.},

Here we propose an E(3)-equivariant deep-learning framework to represent density functional theory (DFT) Hamiltonian as a function of material structure, which can naturally preserve the Euclidean symmetry even in the presence of spin--orbit coupling. Our DeepH-E3 method enables efficient electronic structure calculation at ab initio accuracy by learning from DFT data of small-sized structures, making the routine study of large-scale supercells (>104 atoms) feasible. The method can reach sub-meV prediction accuracy at high training efficiency, showing state-of-the-art performance in our experiments.
